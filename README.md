Description:
- I wanted to make a user-friendly Web API Application with Eye-Candy in mind.
    The project combines jQuery, BootStrap, Moment, Weather-API(s), JS, CSS, and HTML to create the work, and has many features! These features include, Detailed Weather Reports (Wind-Speed, UVIndex 'with Color-Indicator', Temperature, Date, and Humidity) for the day and following 5 Days, Easy to Read/Use Form Input and corresponding Output, and a "Clear History" button to allow user's to start from fresh for the new week.
